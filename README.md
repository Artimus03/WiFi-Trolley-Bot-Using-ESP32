# WiFi-Trolley-Bot-Using-ESP32

The rapid evolution of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has fostered the need for intelligent automation in industries, leading to enhanced efficiency, connectivity, and real-time data management. In this project, we developed a **WiFi Trolley Bot** using the **ESP32 microcontroller** to enable seamless real-time data transmission and control over WiFi networks. The bot is designed to transport goods autonomously within industrial environments, while being monitored and controlled through a custom-built mobile application developed in **Java**. 

The ESP32 was chosen due to its low power consumption, integrated WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, and high processing speed, making it an ideal candidate for IIoT systems. By leveraging the **ESP32**'s wireless communication features, the bot establishes a stable connection with the control application, allowing users to control the bot remotely and monitor its status in real-time.

The project integrates key components of modern IIoT systems, including wireless communication, real-time control, and system interoperability. As part of an **MHI-sponsored IIoT training**, the project emphasized hands-on application of IIoT concepts, offering insights into the integration of software and hardware in a connected industrial ecosystem. 

The outcomes of the project demonstrate the feasibility of employing WiFi-enabled bots in industrial automation, significantly reducing the need for manual labor and improving operational efficiency. The successful deployment of the bot showcases the potential for further enhancements in the IIoT domain, particularly in optimizing resource management and minimizing human intervention in industrial processes.
